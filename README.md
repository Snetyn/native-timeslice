# Timeslice Timer

A modular timer application built with Expo and React Native.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
npm start
   ```
3. Preview the app on your phone using the Expo Go app (scan the QR code in your terminal or browser).

## Project Structure

- `src/app` – App-level navigation, providers, and configuration
- `src/features` – Feature modules (each feature is self-contained)
- `src/shared` – Shared components, UI, types, and utilities

## Development Approach

- Modular, feature-first architecture
- Incremental development for easy bug detection
- No Android SDK required (use Expo Go for preview)
